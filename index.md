## About 

Transforming my early intrigue in computers and coding into a thriving tech vocation, I am furthering my expertise with a Master's in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. 

My journey has been a mosaic of academic accolades and professional learning. I graduated at the top of my class with a Gold Medal during my Bachelors in Computer Science Engineering, complemented by impactful internships that allowed me to hone my skills while optimizing systems and boosting user engagement.

I am also passionate about Startups, AI, Blockchain and Cybersecurity, constantly exploring new frontiers in these dynamic fields.
